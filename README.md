<h1>Hi!</h1>
Here's one of my first "bigger" project, which is well known to us - Netflix!<br>
This is a project that aims to imitate Netflix rather than being an exact copy of it.

<h1> To build this project, I used:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Styled Components</li>
<li>Framer Motion</li>
<li>React-intersection-observer</li>
<li>React Router</li>
  <li>The Movie Database (TMDB) - the biggest API for movies</li>
<ul>
<h1>Instalation</h1>

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install
  
```

  *Update* <br>
  I have deployed the project using Netlify!<br>
  U can check it here! <br>
